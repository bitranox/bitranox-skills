# Changelog

All notable changes to the bitranox plugin are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Versioning (SemVer): how to pick the next number

Versions track `plugins/bitranox/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Installed copies only re-fetch
when that version changes, so every change under `plugins/bitranox/` must bump it (see
`CONTRIBUTING.md`). Pick the bump by impact on the published surface:

- MAJOR (`X.0.0`): breaking change. Removing/renaming a skill, or changing a skill's
  invocation or behaviour incompatibly.
- MINOR (`x.Y.0`): backward-compatible addition. A new skill, hook, or capability.
- PATCH (`x.y.Z`): backward-compatible fix. A bug fix, wording/doc fix in a skill, added tests.

Repo-meta outside the plugin tree (this file, `README`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, CI) does not ship to
installed copies and needs no bump.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- `computer-use-bash`, `computer-use-git`, `computer-use-ssh` skills: consolidate the global
  shell/git/ssh mechanics that were scattered across project notes. Bash: never dismiss a
  non-zero exit as a quirk, isolate a mutation from a trailing check (exit-code masking),
  pipeline `PIPESTATUS`, pgrep/pkill self-match, don't over-wait. Git: `rev-parse --short`
  takes one rev, the `core.fileMode=false` exec-bit trap (`git update-index --chmod=+x`),
  CRLF/LF, no interactive flags. SSH: remote pgrep/pkill self-match, inline-quoting layers,
  backgrounding drops the session, remote PowerShell needs `-File` not inline.
- `git-footgun-guard` hook: a `PreToolUse(Bash)` guard that blocks the always-broken
  `git rev-parse --short <2+ revs>` (it fails `fatal: needed a single commit`) before it
  produces the confusing error, naming the fix.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- `tell-sweep` hook: a `PostToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit)` guard that flags AI-writing
  typographic and invisible tells (em/en-dashes, curly quotes, ellipsis, guillemets, NBSP,
  ZWSP, BOM, bidi controls) just written to a prose file (`*.md`, `*.markdown`, `*.txt`,
  `CLAUDE.md`). Tells inside inline-code spans and fenced code blocks are ignored, so a file
  that documents the tells does not false-positive on its own examples. Code files are
  skipped; allowed symbols (arrow, multiplication, comparison, check, bullet) never trip it.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- `validate-structured-files` hook: a `PostToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit)` guard that re-parses
  the resulting JSON/YAML/XML and blocks the write (with the parse error fed back) when it no
  longer parses. Skips templates, JSONC, multi-doc YAML, empty stubs, and missing libraries;
  parses XML XXE/billion-laughs-safe.
- `repo-gate` hook: a pre-commit / CI gate. As `PreToolUse(Bash)` it blocks a local
  `git commit` / `gh pr create` on a violation (and no-ops outside this repo); as `--ci` it runs
  the same checks for GitHub Actions. Enforces tests-exist, pytest passes, JSON valid, and LF
  endings; version-bump is enforced in the local pre-commit only, never on a contributor PR.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): reporting check that runs the gate.
- Tests for every shipped hook (previously only skill scripts had them), enforced by a new
  CLAUDE.md guardrail.

### Changed
- `rotating-proxies`: dropped the `import httpx2 as httpx` alias; the script uses `httpx2`
  throughout.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- `edit-json`, `edit-yml`, `edit-xml` skills: edit structured files through a library
  (round-trip + re-validate) instead of by hand or with `sed`/regex.
- Listed `lxml` in `python-use-modern-libraries`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- `block-pgrep-self-match` hook: blocks the `pgrep`/`pkill` bracket-trick self-match.

### Changed
- `self-improve`: require a version bump when propagating shared artifacts.
- Documented the semver versioning rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- Skills audit pass: new skills, performance-reviewer merge, added tests and fixes.
- `rory`: wove the distilled corpus into its references.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- `self-improve`: close the git-config gap when shipping a guard script.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- `skill-writer`: document cross-platform rules for bundled scripts and hooks.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- `self-improve` hook: cut Windows false positives and hardened the gate launcher
  (LF endings, UTF-8, Git-Bash-only guard, 64 KiB transcript-tail read).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Cross-platform hook support, the count-then-enforce escalation ladder, Python helper
  ports, and documentation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Initial marketplace release: the bitranox skill collection (invoked as `/bitranox:<skill>`)
  plus the `self-improve` Stop hook, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the upstream-propagation workflow.
